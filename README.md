well technically i was trying to build a shooter game that about a man who can save the world with his gun against a dragon  i did want to try in future to have more levels but currently it's only a one level , your task is simply to kill the dragon who's hp is 100 before he kills your first !  both of you deal the same damage and have the same hp, it requires only keyboard to be play with
